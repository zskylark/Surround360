# Surround 360 Rendering Software

Surround 360 is a hardware and software system for capturing and rendering 3d (stereo) 360 videos and photos, suitable for viewing in VR. This subdirectory of the project is specific to rendering software.

## Requirements

* The Surround 360 rendering software requires either Linux or Mac OS X

* The essential dependencies of the Surround 360 rendering software are:
  * CMake
  * gflags
  * glog
  * OpenCV 3.0+

* Additional optional functionality depends on:
  * ffmpeg
  * Gooey
  * wx

## Installing Dependencies of the Surround 360 Rendering Software

* After building all of the dependencies and the rendering code itself, there are no further installation steps.

* The build system for the Surround 360 code is CMake.

* This software has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (CMake 3.2.2) and OS X 10.11.5 (using CMake 3.5.1).

* If you are building on OS X, it may be more convenient to use brew to install some dependencies.

* Install CMake (method 1):
  see https://cmake.org

* Install CMake (method 2 - Linux only)
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/cmake-3.x
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install cmake && sudo apt-get upgrade cmake
</pre>

* Install homebrew (on OS X):
  http://brew.sh/, or just run this directly:
<pre>
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</pre>

* Git is used to download and install packages from source (e.g. OpenCV below). Git may come preinstalled (check using git --version). It is not required if using brew in OS X.

* Install Git (method 1 - Linux only):
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

* Install Git (method 2 - OS X only):
<pre>
  brew install git
</pre>

* Install Python (method 1 - Linux only):
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install python
</pre>

* Install Python (method 2 - OS X only):
<pre>
  brew install python
</pre>

* Install gflags (method 1 - Linux only):
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install libgflags2 libgflags-dev
</pre>

* Install gflags (method 2 - OS X only):
<pre>
  brew install gflags
</pre>

* Install glog (method 1 - Linux only):
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev
</pre>

* Install glog (method 2 - OS X only):
<pre>
  brew install glog
</pre>

* Install OpenCV:
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
  cd opencv
  git checkout tags/3.1.0
  cmake -DWITH_IPP=OFF
  make
  sudo make install
</pre>

* Install ffmpeg (method 1):
  see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide

* Install ffmpeg (method 2 - OS X only):
<pre>
  brew install ffmpeg
</pre>

* Install Gooey (method 1):
  see https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey

* Install Gooey (method 2 - Linux only):
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install python-pip
  sudo pip install --upgrade pip
  sudo pip install Gooey
  sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8
</pre>

* Install Gooey (method 3 - OS X only):
<pre>
  pip install --upgrade pip
  sudo pip install Gooey
  brew install wxpython
  brew install wxmac
  brew link wxmac
</pre>

## Compiling the Surround 360 Rendering Software

* After installing all of the dependencies as described above, run:
<pre>
  cd <install path>/surround360/surround360_render
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make
</pre>

* To test that compilation is successful, run:
<pre>
  ./bin/TestRenderStereoPanorama --help
</pre>

* We recommend configuring CMake to compile in Release mode because the code will execute faster. However, you can also set it up for debug mode with:
<pre>
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
</pre>

* Sometimes it is useful to compile with XCode instead of CMake (e.g., to use its profiling and debugging tools). To do so:
<pre>
  cd <install path>/surround360/surround360_render
  mkdir XCodeDebug
  cd XCodeDebug
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Xcode ..
</pre>

* The ISP has been accelerated using Halide (see http://halide-lang.org).  To use Halide follow the Halide installation instruction which inturn on depends on LLVM. Once Halide is built, make some of their test applications or "lessons" to insure that you have correctly built Halide. Then purge your CMakefiles CMakeCache and renvoke cmake:
<pre>
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DHALIDE_DIR=<path to halide dir>
</pre>

Use the "--accelerate" flag on the Raw2Rgb command line to use the Halide implementation.  The "--fast" flag in conjunction with the "--accelerate" flag to get real-time (< 30ms per frame) performance.  This super fast version disables certain features like sharpenning and anti-vignetting which is useful for fast preview.
